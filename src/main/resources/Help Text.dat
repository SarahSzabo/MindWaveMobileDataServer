The available arguments are:

1-Arg Command Line Options:

TGC-Emulator | Starts the ThinkGearConnector Emulator server to generate pseudo-random packet values.
TGC | Uses the ThinkGear Connector to pull live data values from the Mindwave Mobile. The Mindwave headset must be paired and the ThinkGearConnector must be running.

2-Arg Command Line Options:

Viewer TGC-Emulator | Starts the ThinkGearConnector Emulator server to generate pseudo-random packet values and display them on the UI viewer
Viewer TGC | Uses the ThinkGear Connector to pull live data values from the Mindwave Mobile and display them on the UI viewer

Examples:
java -jar MWMDS.jar TGC-Emulator              | Starts TGC Emulator
java -jar MWMDS.jar Viewer TGC-Emulator              | Starts TGC Emulator + Live Viewer
java -jar MWMDS.jar Viewer TGC-Emulator-Squarewave              | Starts TGC Emulator in Squarewave Mode + Live Viewer  (NOTE: Squarewave mode generates a random packet and holds this value for a set period of time, then generates another random packet)
java -jar MWMDS.jar Viewer TGC              | Starts TGC Adapter (TGC Must be Running and Paired with Mindwave Headset)+ Live Viewer

Misc Notes:
No matter what mode is selected, the data will be outputted to the localhost IP address on port 45,000 via UDP.

UDP Packet Format:
ATTENTION MEDITATION DELTA THETA LOWALPHA HIGHALPHA LOWBETA HIGHBETA LOWGAMMA HIGHGAMMA POORSIGNALLEVEL BLINKSTRENGTH for transmission to MAXMSP (or other programs) in the form of a UDP packet.

Note that the UDP packet variables have a space character between them. To use each one, you must break apart this message on the space character.
This can be accomplished by regular expressions.
